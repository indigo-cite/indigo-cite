          <p class="inkling">Federal statutes, like most state statutes, use the § symbol to indicate the specific codified section. Traditionally, the section symbol is always followed by a space—for example, § 107 or §§ 106-107 for a span of sections. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Even though the Uniform System of Citation dictates a space between § and the section number, sometimes in practice that space is intentionally and systematically omitted. The United States Supreme Court itself does not use the space, and some SCOTUS briefs do while others do not (per an unscientific review of 2021 opinions and briefs). The decision may be strategic in briefs subject to a word-count rule such as the 13,000-word maximum imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32. <i>The Bluebook</i>, however, does not on its face permit this deviation. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>The Bluebook</i> has very recently, however, acknowledged the role of word counts in another context: whether to keep the space between F. and Supp. in F. Supp. or between S. and Ct. in S. Ct. This space is technically required by the Uniform System of Citation’s rule that adjacent capitals like S.E. may be closed up, but a capital may not close up with an abbreviation that is not a single capital, like Ct. in S. Ct. As of 2020, <i>The Bluebook</i>’sBluepages Rule B6 softened its stance, advising writers they may close up other traditionally expected spaces in S. Ct. and F. Supp. 2d so as to conserve space. In a potentially controversial (?) stance, we submit that closing up the space between the section symbol and section number may be an equivalent acceptable deviation from traditional citation mechanics, for writers facing word-count pressure. The Supreme Court and members of the Supreme Court Bar do it even when holding a client’s case in their hands. So maybe you can too. </p>

        <h5 id="r16-1-1"><a href="#toc_r16-1-1">R16.1.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>United States Code</a></h5>
        <p>For citations to the current United States Code (the official code of the United States and thus the preferred citation), cite the title, the United States Code, the section symbol or symbols, and section number or numbers being cited. The name of the Act being cited may be included before the citation, if appropriate. </p>
        <p>&lt;title> U.S.C. § &lt;section number>.</p>
        <p>&lt;Name of Act [optional]>, &lt;title> U.S.C. § &lt;section number>.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>17 U.S.C. § 107.</p>
        <p>18 U.S.C. § 1030.</p>
        <p>Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-399i.</p>
        <h5><a href="#toc_"><br /> R16.1.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Year optional for current sections of the United States Code</a></h5>
        <p>The year in a United States Code citation is optional if the citation refers to the current codified statute. Omitting the year from a U.S.C. citation indicates the most current version of the federal statute being cited, whether that current version is published in the codified edition or a more recent supplement issued to amend the codified edition.</p>
        <h5 id="r16-1-3"><a href="#toc_r16-1-3">R16.1.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Historical citations to the United States Code</a></h5>
        <p>The U.S.C. is codified once every six years, with various supplements issued in the interim six years between codification. For historical citations to previous versions of the United States Code, citations should be to the appropriate codifying year (<i>e.g.</i>, 2000, 2006, 2012). Cite the most recent edition that includes the version of the statute being cited. If you are citing to a historical version of a statute first published in a supplement published in the interim period between official codifications, be sure to consult the supplements, indicate the supplement’s title and year of publication in the citation.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 223 (2012 &amp; Supp. I 2013).</p>
        <h5 id="r16-1-4"><a href="#toc_r16-1-4">R16.1.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Unofficial annotated U.S. codes</a></h5>
        <p>If the U.S.C. cite is not available, then cite to an unofficial code such as U.S. Code Annotated or U.S. Code Service. The citation form is </p>
        <p> &lt;title> U.S.C.A. § &lt;section number> (West).</p>
        <p>&lt;title> U.S.C.S. § &lt;section number> (LexisNexis).</p>
        <h5 id="r16-1-5"><a href="#toc_r16-1-5">R16.1.5<span class="wide-space">  </span>Year in unofficial U.S. code citations</a></h5>
        <p>As with the United States Code, the year is not required in citations to the current code.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>5 U.S.C.A. § 572 (West).</p>
        <p>5 U.S.C.S. § 572 (LexisNexis).</p>
        <p>For citations where the date is relevant or for historical code citations, indicate the date parenthetically. The date consist of the year through which the code section is current, or may include “current through” an exact date or legislative session, if relevant.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>5 U.S.C.A. § 572 (West 2021).</p>
        <p>5 U.S.C.S. § 572 (LexisNexis current through July 22, 2021).</p>
        <h5 id="r16-1-6"><a href="#toc_r16-1-6">R16.1.6<span class="wide-space">  </span> Parallel citations to original section numbers</a></h5>
        <p>The original section numbering of enacted legislation does not inherently correspond to the section numbering in codified statutes. When naming and citing an Act in its original enacted form and in its codified form, include parallel citations to original section number in the Act, and the codified location. </p>
        <p>Use the following form: &lt;Name of Statute> &lt;original section number>, &lt;title> &lt;Abbreviation for Name of Statutory Code> § &lt;section number> &lt;(&lt;Name of Publisher, but only if citing unofficial code> &lt;year published>)>.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act § 202, 17 U.S.C. § 271(e).</p>
        <p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 § 103, 17 U.S.C.A. § 1201 (West).</p>
        <p>R16.1.7<span class="wide-space">  </span>Official session laws</p>
        <p>If neither a United States Code or unofficial annotated code citation is available, then cite to the Public Law Number and parallel official session laws (<i>i.e.</i>, the Statutes at Large). Omit the year of passage if it is part of the Act’s name. For a citation without a pincite, use the following format: &lt;Name of Statute,> Pub. L. No. &lt;____>, &lt;volume> Stat. &lt;page number> &lt;(year passed)>. </p>
        <p>The citation may include pincite to the specific section in the original Act and the page in the session laws. For a citation with a pincite, use the following format: &lt;Name of Statute,> Pub. L. No. &lt;____>, &lt;original section number>, &lt;volume> Stat. &lt;page number>, &lt;page pinpoint> &lt;(year passed)>.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Example</b><b>s</b><b>:</b></p>
        <p>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, § 1101, 124 Stat. 119, 141-43 (2010).</p>
        <p>Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-150, 116 Stat. 74.</p>
        <h4 id="r16-2"><a href="#toc_r16-2">R16.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Short Citations</a></h4>
        <p>After a full citation to the United States Code or alternative (or session laws), a short form may be used. These short citations may take various forms but must clearly identify the reference including the pincite.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>§ 107.</p>

          <p class="inkling">“Session laws” are a bound collection of all statutes enacted by a given legislature, each volume collecting statutes chronologically in the year they were passed. The Statutes at Large (“Stat.”) is the official compilation for federal session laws. Generally, only cite to session laws if the official or unofficial code is unavailable or insufficient, or if you need to refer to the historical fact of the statute’s enactment. </p>
