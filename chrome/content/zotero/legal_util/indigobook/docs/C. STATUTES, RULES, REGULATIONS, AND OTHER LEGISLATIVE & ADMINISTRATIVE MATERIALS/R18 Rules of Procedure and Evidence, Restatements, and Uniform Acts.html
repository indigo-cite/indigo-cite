        <p>Cite current federal or state rules by indicating the abbreviation of the source, followed by the rule number. Do not use a section symbol (§) when citing rules of evidence or procedure, unless using a jurisdiction-specific citation form that requires it. Do not include a date for current rules of evidence or procedure. Include the date of repeal if citing a historical rule no longer in force, and other appropriate information in a parenthetical. </p>

        <p>Cite Restatements by indicating the title of the particular Restatement cited, including the ordinal edition such as Restatement (Third) spelled out.</p>
        <p>Follow the title and edition with the number of the section being cited and, parenthetically, the publisher and the year that edition was published. Use the following form: Restatement (&lt;spelled ordinal>) of &lt;Subject Matter> &lt;: Subject-Matter Subtitle (if applicable)> § &lt;section number> (&lt;publisher> &lt;year published>).</p>
        <p>A comment may be indicated by its letter designation after the Restatement section. Comments are abbreviated “cmt.”</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 46 (Am. L. Inst. 1959).</p>
        <p>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 2 cmt. e (Am. L. Inst. 2000).</p>
        <p>Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Servitudes § 7.1 (Am. L. Inst. 2000).</p>
        <p>Do not abbreviate or use numerical form for the ordinal portion of the Restatement title such as “(Second)”. You may optionally abbreviate words in the Restatement title as noted in <a href="#t11">Table T11</a>, such as “Property” as “Prop.” Try to avoid awkward and non-traditional abbreviations such as “Restatement (Third) of Conflict of Ls.” and “Restatement (Second) of Conts.” Use the option to abbreviate words of eight letters or more such as “Enrichment” as “Enrich.” if desired, avoiding ambiguity with established abbreviations.</p>

          <p class="inkling">The recent history of Restatement citations is a good case study in how citation formats evolve and are influenced by user feedback and advocacy. As of the 19th edition of <i>The Bluebook</i>, published in 2010, Restatement citations followed a fairly slim format: </p>
          <p class="inkling">Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 46 (1959). </p>
          <p class="inkling">The 20th edition of <i>The Bluebook</i>, published in 2015, added the requirement of parenthetically indicating the institutional author along with the year in citations to Restatements, Uniform Acts, and Model Rules: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><span class="wide-space">  </span>Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 46 (Am. Law Inst. 1959). </p>

          <p class="inkling">As of 2020, this relatively recent citation development may be appropriate in scholarly legal writing and is used by law reviews closely implementing the latest version of <i>The Bluebook </i>specifically. This suggested citation format has been picked up by some courts but does not appear to have been systematically adopted as of 2022. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Gallardo by &amp; through Vassallo v.
