        <p>Citations to federal administrative rules and regulations take the following form for citing a section. Provide as specific and precise a citation as the source allows.</p>
        <p>&lt;title number of C.F.R. provision> C.F.R. § &lt;section number> &lt;(year published)>.</p>

        <p>Citations to a part (that is a particular, defined “Part”) of the C.F.R. take the following form.: </p>
        <p>&lt;title number of C.F.R. provision> C.F.R. pt. &lt;part number> &lt;(year published)>.</p>

        <p>If the regulation is generally referred to by name or listing the name and/or the name of the agency issuing the regulation would otherwise improve clarity, include it at the beginning of the citation. Citations to administrative rules and regulations that include the regulation name take the following form: </p>
        <p>&lt;Name of the Regulation and/or Name of the Agency Promulgating the Regulation>, &lt;title no. of C.F.R. provision> C.F.R. § &lt;section number> &lt;(year published)>.</p>

        <p>Cite state regulations following the federal format when permitted by the structure and form of the state’s source material. State regulations vary widely from state to state in their structure and form; thus, the appropriate citation to a state regulation—particularly for use within that state—may require consulting a state-specific citation manual such as those listed in <a href="#t3">Table T3</a>.</p>

        <p>Agency adjudications are similar to case citations but more streamlined. Use only the first-listed private party. Omit all procedural words such as “In re” and similar. See <a href="#t2">Table T2</a> of <i>The Indigo Book</i> for specific guidance on citing agency adjudications and arbitration citations.</p>

        <p>Provide a citation to an official or unofficial reporter if available. If an official publication is not available at all or not yet for the adjudication, cite to the agency’s website using a similar format to citing unpublished cases (<a href="#r11-3-4">Rule R11.3.4</a>) and electronic sources (<a href="#r32">Rule R32</a>). A citation to a proprietary database is permitted and may be helpful but is not required. </p>

          <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling </p>
          <p class="inkling">Citations to agency sources must build on the fundamentals of legal citation, while adapting the special conventions of administrative-law practice and the relevant agency or agencies. Fundamentally, all legal citations should provide the correct information including title, issuing agency, date, and indexing information such that the source can be found and the reader can assess the source in context. Special conventions of administrative-law practice vary by federal and state agency. Specialty conventions may include omitting information (such as a date where it is superfluous), citing to agency-specific sources rather than general federal sources, or citing general federal sources plus additional parallel citations, cross-references, and/or URLs. Those who work frequently with a particular agency will often rely more heavily on the agency’s website or other sources than on general publication in the Federal Register.<span class="wide-space">  </span> </p>
          <p class="inkling">For example, a generic citation to agency work by the Federal Communications Commission might look like this, following the overall Uniform System of Citation: </p>
          <p class="inkling">Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, 85 Fed. Reg. 67,450 (Oct. 23, 2020) (to be codified at 47 C.F.R. pt. 64); Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, 85 Fed. Reg. 67,480 (proposed Oct. 23, 2020) (to be codified at 47 C.F.R. pt. 64). </p>
          <p class="inkling">But an attorney or policy advocate knowledgeable about FCC customs might cite the source more like the following, knowing that the Federal Register documents are only a summary of the FCC's full document, released more than two months after the FCC's initial release of the document, and missing the separate statements of FCC commissioners on the document: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, Report and Order on Remand and Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</i>, WC Docket No. 12-375, 35 FCC Rcd. 8485 (Aug. 7, 2020), https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-seeks-reduce-rates-and-charges-inmate-calling-services-0. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><a href="#t1">Table T1</a> provides more detailed information about federal-agency practice, and <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> provides information on state-specific administrative-law citations (acknowledging that comprehensive treatment of state practice is beyond the scope of <i>The Indigo Book</i>). For work focused on particular agencies, any overall source expressing the Uniform System of Citation should be supplemented by obtaining agency-specific citation guides, studying recent samples of work in that agency, and working with experienced practitioners. For these examples, we are grateful to Blake Reid, Clinical Professor and Director of the Samuelson-Glushko Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic at the University of Colorado School of Law.</p>
