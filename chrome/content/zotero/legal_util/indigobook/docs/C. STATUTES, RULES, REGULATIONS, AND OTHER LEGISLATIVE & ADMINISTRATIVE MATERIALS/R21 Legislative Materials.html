          <p class="inkling">Every two years, a new Congress is constituted, based on the two-year term for Members of Congress set forth in Article 1, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. Each of these Congresses has its own number, and that number is crucial in legislative-history citations. The 2021-22 Congress (elected in 2020) is the 117th Congress. Public Laws enacted by this Congress and signed by the President will follow a citation format such as Pub. L. 117-1 (the first act to be enacted sequentially by the 117th Congress). The 2019-2020 Congress (elected in 2018) was the 116th Congress. Those Public Laws would follow a citation format such as Pub. L. 116-25 (the twenty-fifth act to be passed by the 116th Congress); and so on. Likewise other legislative documents use the number of that Congress as a core piece of the citation. Online resources for government-document research seem to be constantly in flux; consult Congress.gov or Govinfo.gov for more information.</p>

        <p>Once enacted, bills and joint resolutions are statutes subject to codification and should be cited as such following <a href="#r16-1">Rule R16.1</a>. For citations to the legislation’s history (rather than as a codified statute), cite them as unenacted bills or resolutions. Cite enacted simple resolutions and concurrent resolutions as if they were unenacted, but add an “(enacted)” parenthetical if it would be helpful.</p>

        <p>Cite state bills and resolutions as follows: &lt;number of bill or resolution>, &lt;number, or year if unnumbered, of the legislative body>, &lt;number or designation of the legislative session> (&lt;name of state, abbreviated as in <a href="#t12">Table T12</a> and year of enactment or publication, if unenacted>).</p>
