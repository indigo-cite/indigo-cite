        <h4 id="r32-1"><a href="#toc_r32-1">R32.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Authenticated, Official, and Exact Copies</a></h4>
        <p>When an authenticated, official, or exact copy of a document is available online, <i>cite</i> as if to the equivalent print source (i.e., URL information should not be included).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Authenticated copy: source that uses some authenticating tool, such as a digital signature. This is generally the preferred version. </li>
          <li>Official copy: version of document designated “official” by a federal, state, or local government. </li>
          <li>Exact copy: unaltered online reproduction of the entirety of a printed source, including pagination.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For sources that are available in a non-internet source, append the URL to the end of the citation if doing so would make accessing the source significantly easier. </p>

        <p>For Internet sources that have the characteristics of a print source, cite as if you were citing the print source, and append the URL to the end of the citation. Internet sources have the characteristics of a print source when the following conditions are met: the source has all the information needed to cite it according to another rule, and the source has a fixed, permanent pagination (such as a PDF).</p>
        <h4 id="r32-4"><a href="#toc_r32-4">R32.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Webpages and Internet Sources</a></h4>
        <p>For citations directly to webpages and other Internet sources that do not exist in any other printed format, follow the formula in <a href="#r33">Rule R33</a> below.</p>

          <p class="inkling">Even in an online world, the format of the printed page reigns supreme in legal citation. Thus, when a document is available in multiple formats, choose the citation format that best preserves the document as it would display if printed. For example, PDF is preferred over HTML. The benefit of these citations is allowing citations to specific page numbers (for pincites) regardless of whether it is being viewed digitally or in print. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Note that many of the Internet citation rules are little more than common sense (that’s a compliment, not a dig). For example: include the URL that most directly links your reader to the authority, as you don’t want to send readers on a wild goose chase through the recesses of the Internet in search of a source. For the sake of completeness, we include these rules below, even though most people would probably intuit them. </p>
          <p class="inkling">One internet citation rule is not common sense, however. Traditional legal citation does not underline the URL to indicate a hyperlink. (Indeed, if you are using italics for case names, titles, and such, nothing will be underlined anywhere in the document.) As you create a citation to an internet source, your word processor may helpfully add an underlined hyperlink with URL text turned a different color. For citation per the Uniform System of Citation, believe it or not, you should remove that formatting change. Depending on the situation, you might choose to leave the non-compliant (yet helpful) obvious hyperlink. You could remove the hyperlink altogether. Or you could change the formatting so the hyperlink works but is rendered in plain font, consistent with traditional legal citation.</p>
