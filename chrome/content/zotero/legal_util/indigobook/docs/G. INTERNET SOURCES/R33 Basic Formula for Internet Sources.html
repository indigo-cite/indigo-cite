        <h5 id="r33-1-1"><a href="#toc_r33-1-1">R33.1.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Personal author</a></h5>
        <p>When available, use the name or names of the individual, personal authors of the source.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>Kate Klonick, <i>Facebook v. Sullivan</i>, Knight First Amend. Inst. (Oct. 1, 2018), https:// knightcolumbia.org/content/facebook-v-sullivan.</p>
        <h4 id="r33-1-2"><a href="#toc_r33-1-2">R33.1.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Institutional authors</a></h4>
        <p>When the name of the individual, personal author is unavailable, use the name of the institution associated with the source if one is clearly apparent. Institutional authors should be omitted if the website’s title makes the domain’s owner clear. Institutional authors should be abbreviated (see <a href="#t12">Table T12</a> and <a href="#t11">Table T11</a> for abbreviations). Excessively long institutional-author names may be truncated, such as by omitting prepositional phrases that are not needed for clear identification.</p>
