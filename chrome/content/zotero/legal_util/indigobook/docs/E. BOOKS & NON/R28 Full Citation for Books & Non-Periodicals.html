        <p>Use standard roman type (not italicized) for the author name or names.</p>
        <h5 id="r28-2-1"><a href="#toc_r28-2-1">R28.2.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Exact names</a></h5>
        <p>In general, list the names of the authors as listed on the publication, such as by including listed first names and middle initials in addition to surnames. Use titles that follow an author’s name (Sr.) but not titles that precede them (Hon.)</p>
        <h5 id="r28-2-2"><a href="#toc_r28-2-2">R28.2.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Multiple authors</a></h5>
        <p>For two authors, list them in the same order as on the publication separated by “&amp;.” For more than two authors, you may list all of the authors with “&amp;” before the last. Or you may use “et al.” after the first-named author.</p>

          <p class="inkling">The “et al.” option for books and law review articles with multiple authors may be a space-saving option, but it may also effectively erase the contribution of co-authors other than the first-named. This citation erasure may occur qualitatively (in how the article is remembered) and/or quantitatively (in various empirical citation rankings). University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Dave Hoffman has argued that all authors should be included in the full citation, and indeed a number of law reviews have rejected the et al. option. Professor Hoffman calls this approach the “Fair Citation Rule. ” </p>
          <p class="inkling">Short-forms for books and law review articles may be based on just the first-named author, an approach consistent with the spirit of efficient short-form citations. But the Fair Citation Rule can be followed in short citations as well, an approach that is less efficient but more representative of the work. </p>

        <h5 id="r28-2-3"><a href="#toc_r28-2-3">R28.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Title of the publication</a></h5>
        <p>Place the publication title in italics.</p>
        <h5 id="r28-2-4"><a href="#toc_r28-2-4">R28.2.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Pincite</a></h5>
        <p>Include the exact page number being cited immediately after the name of the publication. Do not use “at” before the pincite in a full citation. When citing a work organized using sections or paragraphs, use those instead, adding a page number only if helpful.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></p>
        <blockquote>Marc A. Franklin et al., <i>Mass Media Law Cases and Materials</i> 472 (8th ed. 2011).</blockquote>

        <p>The full citation to a book publication has up to four elements in the required parenthetical, in the following order: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Editor (designated as “ed.”) </li>
          <li>Translator (designated as “trans.” and also including the name of the publisher of the translated edition) </li>
          <li>Edition number </li>
          <li>Year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If listing an editor or a translator, then follow the name with the designation “ed.,” or “trans.,” respectively. Do not place a comma before the designation of ed. or trans., but do include a comma after that designation and before the year of publication.</p>
