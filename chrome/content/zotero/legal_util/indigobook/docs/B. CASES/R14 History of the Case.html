        <p>When citing a case, include the subsequent history of the case, subject to several exceptions. Refer to <a href="#t14">Table T14</a> for how to abbreviate explanatory phrases when introducing case history. Italicize the explanatory phrase.</p>

          <p class="inkling">The United States is a common law system, where court decisions play an important role in defining what the law is. To figure out the difference between good law and bad law, we have to look at the case’s subsequent history to make sure it was not vacated or reversed on the point being relied upon in a cited assertion. These types of important subsequent history are required by the Uniform System of Citation. On the other hand, some subsequent history is generally unimportant and should be omitted from the citation. Examples include the denial of a motion for reconsideration, or the denial of a petition for certiorari in a case decided more than two years ago. See <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> for some state-specific variations, and of course follow local practice and local court rules on subsequent history. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Note that subsequent history is the history of that particular case in litigation. If a different case (unrelated parties but a similar legal issue) later overrules an older case’s holding, that case is no longer good law for that point—but subsequent history is not involved in the citation. This is but one example of how legal citation overlaps with legal analysis itself. If a writer is citing a case that was later overruled, the writer should not simply polish the citation’s mandatory subsequent history, but rather re-consider why to cite that “bad law” in the first place.</p>

        <p>Include subsequent history when necessary to protect credibility or clarify the weight of authority for the statement the citation supports. This includes most subsequent history except denials of rehearings or discretionary appeals. This also includes history on remand (which, by its nature, advances the litigation but does not change the law issued from a higher court on appeal), unless relevant to the point being made.</p>
        <h5 id="r14-2-1"><a href="#toc_r14-2-1">R14.2.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Direct subsequent history of the litigation</a></h5>
        <p>Always incorporate the following explanatory phrases when applicable, italicized, and followed by a comma and the citation information for the subsequent history. Include other subsequent history commensurate with this list, to indicate the weight of authority and whether the primary case being cited is good law for all or any points.</p>

        <p>—Note: This would be an appropriate citation while the Supreme Court’s decision and opinion remained pending. After the opinion, it is unlikely that this citation would be needed since the Supreme Court opinion itself is the final authority. </p>

          <p class="inkling">Legal citation is not just a set of formatting rules, but an expression of ethics, an expression extending far beyond the dictate to literally cite one’s sources. The ethical dimensions of legal citation encompass its broader impacts such as how these rules socialize new lawyers-in-training, how they function within the legal world, what they represent about law and its practitioners, what they omit, and what effects they cast over the law’s sphere of influence. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Susie Salmon, <i>Shedding the Uniform: Beyond a “Uniform System of Citation” to a More Efficient Fit</i>, 99 Marq. L. Rev. 763 (2016); Jennifer Elisa Chapman, <i>Citation Ethics: Toward an Ethical Framework of Legal Citation</i> (May 29, 2021), Yale Law Library Citation and the Law Symposium (forthcoming 2021), <i>available at</i> https://ssrn.com/abstract=3856202. Citation of cases involving enslaved persons are one example. Historically, these cases were cited no differently than any other case. As of January 2021, the latest printing of <i>The Bluebook</i> (21st ed.) added a rule to expand the citation for such cases, which must now include a parenthetical indicating that an enslaved person or people were parties or at issue in the case. This Second Edition of <i>The Indigo Book</i> expresses this rule and welcomes the continued examination of legal citation rules and practices. </p>
