        <p>When providing a full citation to a case, you should generally include the following, with the court and year enclosed within a single set of parentheses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Italicized case name followed by an unitalicized comma </li>
          <li>volume number, reporter, first page of the case in the reporter </li>
          <li>comma, space, and pincite to an exact page </li>
          <li>abbreviated court name (if not precisely apparent from the name of the reporter) </li>
          <li>year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Case citations may also include the additional components such as a signal, subsequent history, parallel citations, and explanatory parentheticals. These additional components are sometimes required and sometimes discretionary, as determined by the case’s characteristics, the way the citation supports the text, applicable court rules, or other audience expectations.</p>

        <p>A case citation may also include parallel citation to another print reporter or online location for the case, such as a medium-neutral citation. When the print reporter unambiguously indicates the identity of the court, omit the court from duplication at the end of the citation. When the medium-neutral citation unambiguously indicates the court and year, either or both elements may be omitted from further duplication at the end of the citation.</p>

        <p>If the resulting abbreviation is not ambiguous, words of eight or more letters may be abbreviated to save substantial space in citation sentences and clauses. As a guide, remember that citation sentences and clauses stand apart from the prose text they support, and thus can prioritize efficiency over readability; but clarity and preciseness are still important factors.</p>
        <h4 id="r11-4"><a href="#toc_r11-4">R11.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Limited Case-Name Abbreviations in Textual Sentences</a></h4>
        <p>Textual sentences—i.e. grammatical prose for the reader, as opposed to citation “sentences” and clauses interspersed between textual sentences—may include case names and full or short case citations. When including a case name within a textual sentence, case-name abbreviations are sharply limited. The purpose is to prioritize sentence readability over citation efficiency. Case names within textual sentences should abbreviate well-known acronyms and the eight words listed in the table below. While abbreviations are limited, note that the general rules for truncating case names in<a href="#r11-5"> R11.5</a> still apply. Thus, many words are omitted following<a href="#r11-5"> R11.5</a>, but the words that are included are not abbreviated unless allowed by this rule. The guiding principles are shortening long case names while preserving readability in textual sentences. </p>

          <p class="inkling">Legal citation allows—and indeed requires—abbreviation of commonly recognized organizations, such as NASA for the National Aeronautical and Space Administration and FBI for Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Obscure factoid: NASA is an abbreviation because it is drawn from the first letter of each word but pronounced as a word, whereas FBI is a sub-type of abbreviation called an initialism because it is drawn from the first letter of each word with each letter articulated separately in the spoken abbreviation.) But what, exactly, meets the standard for being commonly recognized? One useful test is to look at recent, credible journalism as a gauge of what is commonly known. For example, the New York Times abbreviates Environmental Protection Agency as EPA but does not abbreviate Fish and Wildlife Services as FWS. Another test is to informally survey at a handful of recent cases. For example, PETA and the USDA are used in case names, suggesting that they <i>are</i> commonly recognized, at least for legal-citation purposes. </p>
          <p class="inkling">But don’t overdo it with the acronyms; keep in mind the scolding Judge Silberman issued in a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: “The use of obscure acronyms, sometimes those made up for a particular case, is an aggravating development of the last twenty years.” <i>Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. FERC</i>, 753 F.3d 1304, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (Silberman, J., concurring). With this judge’s aggravation in mind, use only those abbreviations and acronyms that are easy to understand and make the reader’s work easier.<span class="wide-space">  </span></p>

The standard national citation practice is to cite to the West National Reporter System although many states have a state-specific official reporter or official public-domain citation system (not reliant on a private publisher’s system).

        <h5 id="r11-6-3"><a href="#toc_r11-6-3">R11.6.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Parallel citation in state court documents</a></h5>
        <p>When submitting documents to state courts, follow the local rules for citations, selectively indicated in <a href="#t3">Table T3</a>. State courts’ local rules often require a parallel citation: i.e., a citation to both the official state reporter, followed by the unofficial regional and/or state-specific reporter. Each reporter will have different page numbers, so provide a pincite for each. Also, when the official reporter title makes the state or court name apparent, don’t include it again in parentheses.</p>

        <h4 id="r11-7"><a href="#toc_r11-7">R11.7<span class="wide-space">  </span>Pincites</a></h4>
        <p>Each case citation, whether full or short, should include a pincite to direct the reader to the specific page being cited. </p>
        <p>In a full citation to a case, include a pincite after the first page where the case is found in the reporter. If the pincite is the first page of the opinion, be sure to still include it by just repeating the number. Pincites are required in both full and short citations when those citations support a reference to a specific page of the case. <i>See</i> <a href="#r15">Rule R15</a> on short citations for cases and <a href="#r6">Rule R6</a> on full and short citations generally.</p>
        <p>Pincites can be used to identify the page source for content of an explanatory parenthetical. Pincites can also be used to identify the page source for content in the textual sentence supported by the citations sentence or clause that follows. </p>
