          <p class="inkling">Court abbreviations in case citations convey crucial information. For example, a case citing “N.Y.” refers to the highest court in the state of New York—the New York Court of Appeals. But “N.Y. Sup. Ct.” is the proper abbreviation for the New York Supreme Court—which some will be surprised to know is the name of the trial-level court in the state of New York, not the state high court. Generally see <a href="#t12">Table T12</a> for the correct abbreviation for each state; and specifically see <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> and official state-court websites to confirm the name and level of each court. Finally, refer to <a href="#t9">Table T9</a> for general court abbreviations. </p>

        <p>If the identity of the court is clearly and unambiguously indicated by the reporter’s name, do not include the court in the parenthetical information with the year.

        <p>Some opinions are so new and pending that they have not yet been assigned to reporters. These early opinions are referred to as “slip opinions,” presumably because they are (or historically, were) rendered on slips of paper rather than in printed bound volumes. </p>
        <p>Some opinions are designated “not for publication” by the issuing court, and will never be assigned an official reporter citation. Pending and unreported cases generally can be found in one of the following three source below.</p>

        <p>Citations to these electronic databases are similar to regular citations, using the database code from LEXIS or Westlaw as a substitute for the (non-existent) reporter citation. Pending-case citations have two additional components: (a) add the docket number before the database code, and (b) include the full calendar date of the decision in the following parenthetical, not just the year. Pincites are indicated with “at” and a * attached to the page number.</p>
        <p>Citations to these electronic databases should be formatted as follows: &lt;Case Name>, &lt;case docket number>, &lt;database identifier and electronic report number>, at *&lt;star page number> &lt;(court, full date)>.</p>
