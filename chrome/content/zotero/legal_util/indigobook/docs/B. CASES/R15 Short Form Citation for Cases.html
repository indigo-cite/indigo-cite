        <p>Once a case has been cited in full, you may refer to the case by a short-citation form. Specifically, you may refer to the case name in a textual sentence and provide shortened citation information after the sentence. </p>
        <p>For the case name, use the chosen party’s name—usually the first-named party’s name—consistent with these rules for selecting a short-form citation and consistent with the abbreviation rules in <a href="#r11">Rule R11</a> for all case names (full citation or short citation). For the citation format, include the volume of the reporter, the reporter, the word “at” and the pincite to the page being cited.</p>
        <p>Within the text sentence or (preferably) after the text sentence, provide a truncated citation sentence in the form of &lt;volume> &lt;Name of Reporter> at &lt;pincite>.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b> </p>
        <p>The court in <i>Fenton</i> also held the lower court erred in awarding damages based on loss of fair market value of property due to the flying balls. 233 N.E.2d at 219.</p>
        <p>As the court further noted in <i>Fenton</i>, 233 N.E.2d at 219, the lower court erred in awarding damages based on loss of fair market value of property due to the flying balls. </p>
        <h4 id="r15-2"><a href="#toc_r15-2">R15.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">  </span>Short Citations in Citation Sentences and Clauses</a></h4>
        <p>Case names can be long, so various short-citation forms must be used when referring to the same case repeatedly in sequence or in scattered, interspersed references. <i>Id.</i> is the preferred reference if it can be used as noted below, because it is the most concise. But other short forms are frequently required for interspersed references throughout a legal document.</p>
        <h5 id="r15-2-1"><a href="#toc_r15-2-1">R15.2.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>When a short form may be used</a></h5>
        <p>Once a case has been cited in full, you may refer to the case by a short-citation form. Specifically, you provide a short-form citation sentence or clause with truncated information compared to the full citation. The reference must be unambiguous, and the full citation must be easily accessible earlier in the text. </p>
        <p>Discretion may be applied to repeat the full-citation form later in a document when useful to the reader, such as after five short-form uses of <i>id.</i>, five footnotes using <i>id.</i>, or after a new heading or page break.</p>
        <h5 id="r15-2-2"><a href="#toc_r15-2-2">R15.2.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Form of short citations</a></h5>
        <p>In general, the short citation uses the first-named party in the case name. As with full citations, the case name is italicized but the comma after the case name is not italicized. The shortened citation form omits the “v.” (for versus) and second-named party after the “v.” The shortened citation form also omits the first page of the case as found in the reporter, and simply provides an “at” with the pincite.</p>
        <p>For cases, a short form citation usually includes: &lt;The First Party of the Case Name>, &lt;volume number> &lt;Reporter> at &lt;pincite>. As shown in <a href="#r15-1">Rule R15.1</a>, if the shortened case name is incorporated into the textual sentence, do not repeat that shortened name in the short-form citation after the textual sentence.</p>
        <p><b>Examples (where case name not part of preceding textual sentence):</b></p>
        <p><i>Fenton</i>, 233 N.E.2d at 219.</p>
        <p><i>Malletier</i>, 500 F. Supp. 2d at 281.</p>
        <h5 id="r15-2-3"><a href="#toc_r15-2-3">R15.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Exceptions to using the first party of the case name</a></h5>
        <p>Do not use the first party of the case name if that party either is a geographical or governmental unit or a party name that is used for multiple cases. Choose the second party name if needed to avoid confusion.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p><i>United States v. Carmel</i>, 548 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 2008) becomes <i>Carmel</i>, 548 F.3d at 573.</p>
        <p><i>Gonzalez v. Raich</i>, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) becomes <i>Raich</i>, 545 U.S. at 8.</p>
        <h5 id="r15-2-4"><a href="#toc_r15-2-4">R15.2.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Shortening party names</a></h5>
        <p>Shorten a long party name, but only if the shortening saves significant useful space and if the reference remains clear. Use a [hereinafter &lt;x>] designation if needed.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p><i>Home Depot USA, Inc. v. Jackson</i>, 139 S. Ct. 1743, 1744 (2019) becomes <i>Home Depot</i>, 139 S. Ct. at 1744. </p>

        <p>If you are citing to the same case referenced in the immediately preceding citation, use <i>id.</i> as the short form citation. <i>Id.</i> by itself refers to the same case and same pincite in that case.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>When the author of a work is a judge or legislator, it carries the force of law and cannot be copyrighted. <i>Georgia v. Public.Resource.org</i>, 140 S. Ct. 1498, 1513 (2020). To hold otherwise would be to discourage the use of “official legal works that illuminate the law we are all presumed to know and understand.” <i>Id.</i></p>

        <p>If you are referring to the immediately preceding case, but to a different page, use <i>id.</i> at &lt;pincite>.</p>

          <p class="inkling">The short form id.—capitalized as Id. when it starts a citation sentence—can be used only to refer to the immediately preceding citation. The standard for what is immediately preceding is strict. Do not use id. simply because a full citation has been given somewhere at some point previously in the text; it is not catchall short citation but must be tailored to context. Id. can be used after a citation to a single source (a full or a short citation, the important characteristic being a citation to one and only one source). Id. cannot follow a string citation listing two or more sources. It also cannot be used after any intervening textual reference, such as mentioning a different case or other authority by name. Citing multiple sources in a string or mentioning other intervening sources creates possible ambiguity and thus makes id. unhelpful and incorrect. </p>
          <p class="inkling">There is one exception to this strict construction of when to use <i>id.</i> If the preceding citation includes a parenthetical citing a case within that parenthetical, that citation-within-a-citation does not foreclose the use of id. In that scenario, <i>id.</i> may be used to cite back to the immediately preceding citation to which the citation-within-a-citation is attached. Thus, a source cited parenthetically does not become the immediately preceding citation. This is structurally different from a string citation. Do not use <i>id. </i>after a string citation, even to attempt to refer to the final citation in the string.</p>
