          <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling </p>
          <p class="inkling">The United States Supreme Court is famous for hearing oral arguments and issuing judicial opinions, but it has recently increased the practice of making decisions through the so-called “shadow docket.” E.g., Stephen I. Vladeck, <i>The Solicitor General and the Shadow Docket</i>, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 123 (2019); William Baude, <i>Foreword: The Supreme Court’s Shadow Docket</i>, 9 N.Y.U. J.L. &amp; Liberty 1 (2015). These rulings are issued without full briefing and argument and, in many cases, without identifying a particular justice as the author. </p>
          <p class="inkling">To cite Supreme Court dispositions on its shadow docket, follow Indigo Book Rules<a href="#r11"> R11</a>-R12 on cases citations to the extent possible. For example, provide a citation to Supreme Court Reports until the official United States Reports citation with pagination becomes available. </p>
          <p class="inkling">A parenthetical may be used to indicate the type of ruling, following the title or other information provided with the ruling: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>Tandon v. Newsom</i>, 141 S. Ct. 1294 (2021) (per curiam). <br /> </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>Maryland v. King</i>, 133 S. Ct. 1 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). </p>
          <p class="inkling">Use the above parentheticals only if the disposition explictly indicates it is per curiam or issued by a particular justice in chambers. Other rulings are not labeled as per curiam or signed in chambers. The traditional rule for citing such decisions was to add the parenthetical “(mem.)” after the citation: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>United States v. Higgs</i>, 141 S. Ct. 645 (2021) (mem.). </p>
          <p class="inkling">The decisions falling into this category are not typically labeled “memorandum” by the Court itself; rather, this label comes from traditional citation practice to indicate what would otherwise look the same as a full opinion. Thus, we submit that other more descriptive parentheticals may be used in addition to or instead of (mem.) to indicate the posture of the decision: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>United States v. Higgs</i>, 141 S. Ct. 645 (2021) (emergency vacatur of stay and reversal, designating Indiana as state for inmate’s execution under 18 U.S.C. § 3596). </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson</i>, 141 S. Ct. 2494 (2021) (mem.) (unsigned, on application for injunctive relief). </p>
          <p class="inkling">Shadow-docket decisions by the majority of the Court can be, and recently often are, accompanied by signed concurring or dissenting opinions. Dissents and other statements attached to the decision may be indicated in a similar fashion to concurrences and dissents from fully argued opinions on the merits. When one justice concurs or dissents in an opinion attached to a shadow docket decision and one or more justices join that opinion, indicate only the authoring justice. Indicate a pincite to concurring or dissenting opinions. The parenthetical (mem.) or other appropriate notation may optionally be included as well, to indicate that the concurrence or dissent is referring to an action that does not itself constitute a full formal opinion. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t<span class="wide-space">  </span>of Health &amp; Hum. Servs.</i>, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2485 (2021) (mem.) (Roberts, C.J., concurring). </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>United States v. Higgs</i>, 141 S. Ct. 645, 647 (2021) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting from vote).</p>
