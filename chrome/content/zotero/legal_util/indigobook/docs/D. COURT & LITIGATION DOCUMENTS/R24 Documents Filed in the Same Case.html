        <p>At the trial stage, court and litigation documents take a variety of forms such as pleadings, affidavits, discovery requests and responses, motions, and court orders, just to name a few. On appeal, the record below may become a formal numbered “Record” with its own page references. Documents for use on appeal may also take the form of an appendix or joint appendix. </p>
        <p>In federal court, court and litigation documents must be filed with the federal government’s Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, variously known as CM/ECF (for case management and electronic case filing, respectively) and PACER (for accessing case materials). Thus, federal court documents have traditional document names, pagination, and in some types of pleading documents, paragraph designations provided by the filer; as well as an assigned ECF number for the document and PageID numbering within the document provided by the CM/ECF system. </p>

        <p>Consult the document abbreviations in <a href="#t18">Table T18</a>. Follow it in the absence of more specific rules or guidance from local rules. When abbreviating document names, other abbreviations may be employed for long words (typically seven or more letters) if clear and helpful to the reader. Always abbreviate an official record, such as the appellate record, to “R.” Do not abbreviate if the abbreviation would confuse the reader. </p>

        <h4 id="r24-2"><a href="#toc_r24-2">R24.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Pincites to Page, Page and Line, or Paragraph </a></h4>
        <p>For court and litigation documents other than an appellate record, provide the exact page or paragraph. Where line numbers are available such as in deposition transcripts, also provide the line being referred to. Do not use “p.” before a page number, but refer to pages with “at &lt;x>.” </p>
        <h5 id="r24-2-1"><a href="#toc_r24-2-1">R24.2.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Pincites to the appellate record<span class="wide-space">  </span></a></h5>
        <p>Generally cite the appellate record with an “at.” Record citations also sometimes omit the “at” to save on a word count. Most importantly, be accurate and be internally consistent.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>

        <h5 id="r24-2-2"><a href="#toc_r24-2-2">R24.2.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Page and line pincites</a></h5>
        <p>Use a colon to separate page and line.</p>

        <h5 id="r24-2-3"><a href="#toc_r24-2-3">R24.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Commas</a></h5>
        <p>Use commas if necessary to avoid confusion. When abbreviating both a document name and an exhibit to that document, add a comma after the Exhibit reference before the pincite.</p>

        <h4 id="r24-3"><a href="#toc_r24-3">R24.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Date of Document</a></h4>
        <p>Include the date of the document if the date is particularly relevant or if omitting the date could cause confusion.</p>

        <h4 id="r24-4"><a href="#toc_r24-4">R24.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Electronic Case Filing Number</a></h4>
        <p>Include an ECF number whenever a document has been filed electronically. Find the ECF number on PACER, a federal case management system that assigns each case document a document number. Use the page number on the original document, not the Page ID reference added by the ECF system upon filing, except in citations provided to a court where applicable court rules require using the ECF’s Page ID reference. </p>

        <p>Citations to court or litigation documents may stand alone as citation sentences or clauses, or may be enclosed in parentheses or brackets. If using parenthesis or brackets, place the period outside the closing parenthesis or closing bracket. As with all types of citations, following applicable court rules and maintaining internal consistency in a document are crucial.</p>
