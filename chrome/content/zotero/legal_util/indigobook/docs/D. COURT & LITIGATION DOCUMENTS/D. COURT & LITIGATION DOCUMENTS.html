          <p class="inkling">Section B of <i>The Indigo Book</i> (Rules<a href="#r11"> R11</a>-R15) focuses on citations to “cases”—that is judicial opinions, both published and unpublished. But not everything a court issues is an “opinion.” An opinion states the court’s legal basis and reasoning for that decision. An order manages and directs the litigation in a particular case. Rules<a href="#r24"> R24</a>-27 address court and litigation documents, and here we note the connection to case citations. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Citing orders to a court during active litigation in that court will vary and depend on that court’s own rules and customs. In contexts outside the litigation, orders should be cited consistently with the opinion rules in <a href="#r12-4-1">Rule R12.4.1</a> Thus, an order in a 2022 labor dispute involving a Memphis Starbucks would be cited differently when participating in the litigation and outside of it. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Briefing in the context of the litigation: </p>
          <p class="inkling">(ECF No. 45 at PageID 478, n. 1). </p>
          <p class="inkling">Citation in public contexts outside the litigation: </p>
          <p class="inkling"><i>McKinney v. Starbucks Corp.</i>, No. 2:22-cv-02292, <i>Order Denying in Part and Granting in Part Motion of Workers United to Intervene or, in the Alternative, to Participate as Amicus Curiae,</i> at 2, n. 1 (W.D. Tenn. May 10, 2022). </p>
          <p class="inkling">ECF and Page ID page citations vary court by court, and full coverage of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system and PACER is beyond the scope of <i>The Indigo Book. </i>We note our support for open-access initiatives such as RECAP, which is a searchable online archive, browser extension, and email alert capturing utility made available by the Free Law Project and Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton.</p>
