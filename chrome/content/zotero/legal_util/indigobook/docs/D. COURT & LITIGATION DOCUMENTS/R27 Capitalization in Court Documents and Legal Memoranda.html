        <p>Capitalize “Court” in each of the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Referring to the U.S. Supreme Court </li>
          <li>Referring to or addressing the court receiving the document you are submitting </li>
          <li>Naming the court in full</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>The Court held that the Official Code of Georgia Annotated is a government edict that cannot be copyrighted by the State of Georgia. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Court of Federal Claims held jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>The <i>Aalmuhammed</i> court explained that the word author “is traditionally used to mean the originator or the person who causes something to come into being.”</p>
        <p>This Court is being asked to expand the definition of “author” far beyond the statutory text. </p>

        <p>Capitalize “Plaintiff,” “Defendant,” “Appellant” and “Appellee,” unless you are referring to parties from other litigation.</p>
        <p><b>Example (in the case involving this plaintiff as a party): </b></p>
        <p>The Plaintiff does not have a cognizable copyright interest in her acting performance.</p>
        <p><b>Example (referring to a different litigation):</b></p>

        <p>In litigation filings, use the capitalized and unabbreviated title of any litigation document in that case, when referring to it in full in a textual sentence. A litigation document may also be referred to in a citation sentence in a full or short form, in which case it should be capitalized but abbreviated. </p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><span class="wide-space">  </span><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>The Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration should be denied.</p>
