        <h4 id="r6-1"><a href="#toc_r6-1">R6.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Full Citations </a></h4>
        <p>Provide a full citation to a source the first time it is cited. Refer to the rules in <i>The Indigo Book</i> for examples of each source in full-citation form.</p>
        <h4 id="r6-2"><a href="#toc_r6-2">R6.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Short Citations</a></h4>
        <p>Legal citation provides frequent specific citations not just to sources as a whole, but to specific pages within sources. In some standard legal documents, every textual sentence is followed by a citation to a supporting legal source. Short-citation forms allow frequent citation in a less intrusive and repetitive way, since many full citation forms are quite long. </p>
        <h5 id="r6-2-1"><a href="#toc_r6-2-1">R6.2.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Short citations derived from the full citation</a></h5>
        <p>Short-form citations enable various sources to be used throughout a passage without repeating the entire full citation every time. Short-form citations generally identify the source and pincite, using a form that follows from the full citation form, while not repeating every detail from the full citation.</p>
        <p>Every full citation has at least one short form that can be used later in a document after the initial full citation. Refer to the source-specific rules in the Indigo Book for short-citation form examples of each source. </p>
        <h5 id="r6-2-2"><a href="#toc_r6-2-2">R6.2.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Use of <i>Id.</i></a></h5>
        <p>Use the short form <i>Id.</i> (capitalized in a citation sentence after a text sentence) or <i>id.</i> (uncapitalized within a sentence as citation clause) to support a statement where it refers to the same exact source cited in the immediately preceding citation. <i>Id.</i> can be used for statutes, regulations, cases, and most other sources. </p>
        <p><i>Id. </i>can be used alone, to indicate the same page of the same source. It can be used with a new pincite to a page, section, or other subdivision, to indicate a different portion of the immediately preceding source. <i>Id.</i> can also refer to a preceding citation that is itself <i>Id.</i> or another short form of a citation. Use “at” to indicate a pincite to a page. Do not use “at” with <i>Id.</i> followed by a section or paragraph pincite.</p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span><i>Id.</i> at 1512. </p>
        <p><i><span class="wide-space">  </span>Id.</i> § 9.</p>
        <p><i><span class="wide-space">  </span>Id.</i> ¶ 12.<span class="wide-space">  </span></p>
        <p>In general, do not use <i>id. </i>if it causes confusion or does not save space. For example, <i>id.</i> cannot be used after a string citation, even to refer to the final source listed in that string. Do not use <i>id.</i> to refer to appellate-record citations such as R. at 2. It may be used for sources with longer names in litigation documents, so long as the reference remains clear. </p>
        <p><i>Id.</i> can be used in either in-text citations or footnotes. <i>Id.</i> is typically not used more than four times sequentially in footnotes.</p>
        <h5 id="r6-2-3"><a href="#toc_r6-2-3">R6.2.3 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Use of <i>supra</i> </a></h5>
        <p><i>Supra</i> may be used as part of a short-form citation with secondary sources such as books, periodicals, internet sources. Legislative hearings may be referred to with <i>supra</i>. Do not use <i>supra</i> with primary sources such as cases, statutes, constitutions, and most legislative materials (hearings excepted). Also do not use <i>supra</i> with Restatements, model codes, or regulations. </p>
        <p>Apart from its use in selected legal citations, <i>supra </i>may also be used as an internal cross reference.</p>

          <p class="inkling">In academic legal documents using footnotes, a “preceding five” norm has developed wherein one may continue to use a short form citation as long as the full citation appears in one of the previous five footnotes. </p>
          <p class="inkling">There has been some variation in the application of this rule; for example, some practitioners will continue to use the short form throughout an entire article or brief unless they need to use “<i>id.</i>” repeatedly, in which event they follow the “preceding five” rule to avoid potential ambiguity. However, none of these conventions are absolute. Short-citation forms should be used in a clear, consistent, and helpful manner.</p>
