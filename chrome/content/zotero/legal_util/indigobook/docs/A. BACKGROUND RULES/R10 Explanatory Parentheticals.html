        <p>Sometimes, it is helpful to include extra information to explain the relevance of certain citations. Explanatory parentheticals may consist of phrases typically started with a present participle such as (holding . . . ), direct quotations from the source, or short statements. Parentheticals also provide information about the weight of the authority cited, particularly with cases.</p>

        <p>If not quoting the authority, do not begin an explanatory parenthetical with capital letter.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote><i>Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.</i>, 109 F.3d 1394 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that publisher’s asserted parody of O.J. Simpson murder trial was substantially similar to copyrighted work).</blockquote>

        <p>If quoting the authority, only begin parenthetical with capital letter and end with a period when the parenthetical quoted is or reads as a complete sentence.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote><i>See</i> <i>Ty, Inc. v. Publ’ns Int’l Ltd.</i>, 292 F.3d 512, 520 (7th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he shortage that creates the secondary market stampedes children into nagging their parents to buy them the latest Beanie Babies, lest they be humiliated by not possessing the Beanie Babies that their peers possess.”).</blockquote>

        <p>Some citations need to provide other types of parentheticals about the source itself, and these source-related parentheticals are given before explanatory parentheticals. </p>
        <p>Examples of source-related parentheticals include information about a judicial opinion’s weight of authority as (per curiam) or (en banc), information about the source as a quote such as information being omitted or emphasis added, information about a source being quoted within the source, and bracketed definitions of the source as a short-form citation, such as [hereinafter “Color of Creatorship”]. </p>
        <p>The source-related parentheticals are followed by the explanatory parenthetical, if any; and last, the prior or subsequent history (<i>see</i> <a href="#r14">Rule R14</a>) as shown in this order of parenthetical types:</p>
        <blockquote>(date) [hereinafter &lt;short name>] (en banc) (&lt;Lastname, J.>, concurring) (plurality opinion) (per curiam) (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting &lt;another source>) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing &lt;another source>), http://www.domainname.com (explanatory parenthetical), prior or subsequent history.</blockquote>
