        <blockquote>Georgia minimizes the OCGA annotations as non-binding and non-authoritative, but that description undersells their practical significance. Imagine a Georgia citizen interested in learning his legal rights and duties. If he reads the economy-class version of the Georgia Code available online, he will see laws requiring political candidates to pay hefty qualification fees (with no indigency exception), criminalizing broad categories of consensual sexual conduct, and exempting certain key evidence in criminal trials from standard evidentiary limitations—with no hint that important aspects of those laws have been held unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court. See OCGA §§ 21-2-131, 16-6-2, 16-6-18, 16-15-9 (available at www.legis.ga.gov). Meanwhile, first-class readers with access to the annotations will be assured that these laws are, in crucial respects, unenforceable relics that the legislature has not bothered to narrow or repeal. See §§ 21-2-131, 16-6-2, 16-6-18, 16-15-9 (available at https://store.lexisnexis.com/products/official-code-of-georgia-annotated-skuSKU6647 for $412.00).</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>Block quotations are single spaced. </li>
          <li>Include a single line space after the block quotation, and resume the spacing convention in the surrounding document text. </li>
          <li>Indent both left and right. </li>
          <li>Block quotations should be formatted with “full justification.” The right and left margins of the block quotation are fully justified, meaning aligned on the left margin and on the right margin. The aligned left and right margins give the block quotation its appearance as a rectangular “block” of text on the page. </li>
          <li>Do not use quotation marks surrounding the block quotation. The block format itself indicates that the material is a quotation, and quotation marks around a block would be redundant. (Exception: Use quotation marks if the entire block quotation is itself a quotation within the source being quoted, and indicate the internal quotation and source parenthetically after the block.) </li>
          <li>In general, internal quotation marks should appear as in the original. <span class="wide-space">  </span> </li>
          <li>The citation following a block quotation should start at the line’s left margin, without any indentation. This citation can be a full citation or a short citation, as the circumstances dictate. It should include a pincite to the page or pages where the quoted material is found.</li>
        </ul>
