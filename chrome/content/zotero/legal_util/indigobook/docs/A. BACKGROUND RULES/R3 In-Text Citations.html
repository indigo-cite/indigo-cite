        <h4 id="r3-1"><a href="#toc_r3-1">R3.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Three Options for In-Text Citations</a></h4>
        <p>For standard legal documents, in-text citations can be rendered in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a complete sentence that supports a claim in the immediately preceding sentence of text; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>a clause within the sentence when the citation relates to a particular part of a sentence, immediately following the claim it supports; or</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>embedded within the sentence’s own grammatical flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="r3-2"><a href="#toc_r3-2">R3.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Citation Sentences</a></h4>
        <p>Citations in standard legal documents often follow complete text sentences.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Under the due process requirement, there must be “some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.” <i>Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland,</i> 347 U.S. 340, 344-345 (1954).</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Electronic signatures have the same legal effect as signatures signed with pen and ink. The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001-7006.</blockquote>
        <p>Citations following sentences can be single citations or, when appropriate, several sequential citations separated by a semicolon (known as a “string citation”). These string citations can utilize citation signals consistent with <a href="#r4">Rule R4</a> to show the relationship of the citation to the textual sentence.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Prior to 2018, Supreme Court precedent had required a seller to have a physical presence within a state as a requirement of state taxation. <i>See</i> <i>Quill Corp. v. North Dakota</i>, 504 U.S. 298 (1992); <i>Nat’l Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep’t of Rev. of Ill.</i>, 386 U.S. 753 (1967).</blockquote>
        <h4 id="r3-3"><a href="#toc_r3-3">R3.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Citation Clauses</a></h4>
        <p>Some citations in standard legal documents are placed as citation clauses within sentences. Use citation clauses to cite sources and authorities that relate to only a section of the sentence. A citation clause directly follows the claim it relates to. It may include a signal to indicate the relationship of the cited source to the claim. </p>
        <p>Separate citation clauses from the text with commas. Do not add additional capital letters beyond the required capitalization of the sources being cited.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b> </p>
        <p>Federal law attempts to address online privacy generally, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2523, and children’s privacy specifically, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6505.</p>
        <p>Although detailed regulations apply to children’s privacy online, 16 C.F.R. pt. 312, significant gaps remain in both federal and state law. </p>
        <h4 id="r3-4"><a href="#toc_r3-4">R3.4 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Citations Embedded in Sentences</a></h4>
        <p>Citations can be embedded into the grammatical structure of a textual sentence in a variety of ways. Because citations embedded in sentences are read as part of the sentence’s grammatical flow, the rules for abbreviating case names are different and more restrictive than for citation sentences and clauses.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>Since <i>Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 312 U.S. 359, 366 (1941), the Court has eschewed the idea that a constitutional right could be grounded in “the practical opportunities for tax avoidance.</p>
        <p>In <i>Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</i>, the Court first eschewed the idea that a constitutional right could be grounded in “the practical opportunities for tax avoidance.” 312 U.S. 359, 366 (1941),</p>
        <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6505 (“COPPA”), was the first federal law specifically protecting children under the age of 13.</p>

          <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling </p>
          <p class="inkling">Traditionally, the citations within standard legal documents have been integrated into the main body text. These citations may be placed directly after textual sentences, in citation sentences; as citation clauses within sentences; or textually embedded within sentences. Traditionally, law review articles present their citation support via extensive footnotes in a distinctive format with three different font styles (roman, italics, and Small Caps). </p>
          <p class="inkling">Some courts and lawyers are now producing standard legal documents using footnotes rather than in-text citations. Legal scholar, speaker, and advocate Bryan A. Garner is the best-known proponent of footnotes in standard legal documents, arguing that in-text citations interfere with textual flow and disguise bad writing. Others such as Professor Alexa Chew argue that in-text citations are superior because they integrate source information into the text, a process that can be accomplished with style and grace. The Indigo Book provides citation rules that can be used for either in-text or footnoted citations in standard legal documents. </p>
          <p class="inkling">The original edition of <i>The Indigo Book</i> advised writers to use footnotes only when allowed by a court’s local rules. This remains good advice, although we note that some writers use footnotes when not expressly prohibited by a court’s local rules. <a href="#r3">Rule R3</a> has been modified to more fully accommodate the writer’s discretion. As with many discretionary choices, writers should select an approach based on the document’s purpose, audience, and overall context.</p>
