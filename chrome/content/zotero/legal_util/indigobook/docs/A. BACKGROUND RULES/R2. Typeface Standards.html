          <p class="inkling">The typewriter was invented around the 1860s. The first edition of The Bluebook is from 1926. Typewriters of that era did not support italics or boldface. If you wanted to emphasize text, your sole option was to underline. Throughout The Indigo Book, you'll see us italicizing text rather than underlining, because that’s how we do it in the 21st Century. For an archaic look or where local court rules require, underlining is a good option. If you have a choice, we believe italics are easier to read and should be the preferred method. </p>
          <p class="inkling">While we’re on the subject of formatting text, we also urge writers to format their quotations using all the benefits of modern word processing. Specifically, use well-formatted “smart quotes” (shown here) that curl around the quoted material, rather than "dumb quotes" (shown here) that are the same whether opening or closing a quote. </p>
