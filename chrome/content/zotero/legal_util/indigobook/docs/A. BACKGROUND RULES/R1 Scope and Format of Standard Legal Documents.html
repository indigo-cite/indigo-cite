        <h3 id="r1"><a href="#toc_r1"><b>R1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Scope and Format of Standard Legal Documents</b></a></h3>
        <p>The Uniform System of Citation has split into two main branches, with somewhat different citation rules for each. <i>The Indigo Book</i> is a resource for legal citations in standard legal documents.</p>
        <h4 id="r1-1"><a href="#toc_r1-1">R1.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Standard Legal Documents</a></h4>
        <blockquote><i>The Indigo Book</i> states the rules and provides examples for standard legal documents. We define standard legal documents as documents created for practical law-related purposes such as court filings, legal memoranda, legal analysis, and other forms of legal information that require or benefit from a technically precise and commonly understood citation format. The legal citations for standard legal documents using <i>The Indigo Book</i> adhere to a generally consistent national standard. </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Many state courts and local legal communities use citation formats that vary from this common standard, more so for state and local citations than for federal citations. <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> provides selective information on state variations. In customizing legal citations for a local audience, consult <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> as well as local court rules, customs, and expertise. </blockquote>
        <h4 id="r1-2"><a href="#toc_r1-2">R1.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Academic Legal Documents </a></h4>
        <p>Academic legal documents include articles for publication in law reviews, generally authored by law professors and law students enrolled in J.D. programs. The Uniform System of Citation treats law review articles and standard legal documents differently, requiring different fonts and imposing additional footnote rules. Citations in standard legal documents and law review articles provide the same information about legal sources, and a short cross-reference highlighting key font differences is provided in <a href="#t19">Table T19</a>. A full treatment of formal citation formats for law review articles is outside the scope of <i>The Indigo Book</i>. </p>
