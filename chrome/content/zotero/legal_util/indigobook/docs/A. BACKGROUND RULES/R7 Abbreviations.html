        <h4 id="r7-1"><a href="#toc_r7-1">R7.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Abbreviations Generally</a></h4>
        <p>Legal sources are often long and unwieldy. The tables at the back of <i>The Indigo Book</i> provide various resources for finding appropriate and required abbreviations. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#t1">Table T1</a>, <a href="#t2">Table T2</a>, and <a href="#t3">Table T3</a> provide information and abbreviations relevant to federal and state primary-source citations. </li>
          <li><a href="#t4">Table T4</a> provides abbreviation for looseleaf services compiling cases and other legal sources in frequently updated topical collections. </li>
          <li><a href="#t5">Table T5</a> provides legislative abbreviations. </li>
          <li>Tables<a href="#t6"> T6</a>,<a href="#t7"> T7</a>, and<a href="#t8"> T8</a> provide abbreviations for international, treaty, and arbitration sources. </li>
          <li><a href="#t9">Table T9</a> and <a href="#t10">Table T10</a> provide abbreviations for specific types of U.S. courts and the titles of judges and officials. </li>
          <li><a href="#t11">Table T11</a> is of particular interest to many law students and others grappling with cases and periodical citations. It provides common-word abbreviations used in case names and for institutional authors and periodical titles. <a href="#t12">Table T12</a> provides geographical abbreviations. </li>
          <li><a href="#t13">Table T13</a> provides abbreviations for document subdivisions, and <a href="#t14">Table T14</a> provides abbreviations for explanatory phrases. </li>
          <li><a href="#t15">Table T15</a> provides abbreviations for specific institutional names in periodical titles, and thus these abbreviations take precedence over any conflicting common-word abbreviations for institutional names from <a href="#t12">Table T12</a>. For example, the American Bar Association is ABA, not Amer. Bar. Ass’n, when used as an institutional author. </li>
          <li><a href="#t16">Table T16</a> provides abbreviations for publishing terms such as editor and translator. <a href="#t17">Table T17</a> provides abbreviations for the months of the year, needed in some periodical citations and in slip-opinion citations and other cases found online rather than in reporters (thus requiring exact dates). </li>
          <li><a href="#t18">Table T18</a> is new to the Second Edition of <i>The Indigo Book</i> and provides abbreviations for litigation documents such as citing an affidavit or petition for certiorari. </li>
          <li><a href="#t19">Table T19</a> is also new and shows selective examples of how the Uniform System of Citation produces citations in standard and academic formats—in other words, a guide to converting the practical citations in <i>The Indigo Book</i> into a citation for an academic legal document (a law review). This Table is certainly not comprehensive but provides a quick view into the font differences within the two branches of the Uniform System of Citation. </li>
          <li>Finally, <a href="#t20">Table T20</a> provides selective citations to additional online citation guides. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="r7-2"><a href="#toc_r7-2">R7.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Ordinal Abbreviations in Citations</a></h4>
        <p>Ordinal abbreviations are used for the court/year parenthetical in a case citation, the numerical designation of a Congress, a publication’s addition number, and other contexts. <i>See</i> <a href="#r11">Rule R11</a> generally and <a href="#t1">Table T1</a> for the United States Courts of Appeals (i.e. the various federal circuit courts). In citations and in textual references, ordinal abbreviations do not use superscripts. In citations, abbreviations for “second” and “third” use ordinal style references 2d and 3d, respectively. Extrapolate to larger ordinal numbers ending in second or third, such as “twenty third” becoming “23d” in a citation.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>
        <blockquote>1st Dist.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>2d Cir.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>2d ed.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>3d Dist.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>4th Cir. </blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Incorrect:</b></blockquote>
        <blockquote>2nd, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3rd, 3<sup>rd</sup></blockquote>
        <blockquote>4<sup>th</sup> Cir.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>5<sup>th</sup> Dist.</blockquote>
        <p>Ordinals are also used in federal case citations:</p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>F. Supp. 2d</p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>F.3d</p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>F.4th </p>
        <p>Do not abbreviate the ordinal in a citation to the Restatement either in textual sentences or citations:</p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>Restatement (Second) of Torts (Am. L. Inst. 1977)</p>
        <h4 id="r7-3"><a href="#toc_r7-3">R7.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Textual References </a></h4>
        <p>Citations incorporated into textual sentences—as opposed to citation sentences, clauses, and footnotes—use different abbreviation rules to preserve readability. <i>See</i> <a href="#r3">Rule R3</a> (general guidance on citation sentences and textual sentences incorporating citations) and <a href="#r11-4">Rule R11.4</a> (abbreviation rules for case names in textual sentences).</p>
        <p>When not providing a precise citation at all, but referring to a court in a textual sentence, spell out the court’s name consistent with common practice. <i>See </i><a href="#r27">Rule R27</a> on capitalizing “Court” in court documents and legal memoranda.)</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The Second Circuit has decided many fair-use cases.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The Florida Supreme Court overruled the Fourth District Court of Appeal’s previous holding on judges’ use of Facebook. </blockquote>
