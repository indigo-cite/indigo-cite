        <p>A legal citation usually refers not only to a source in general, but to specific points within that source—whether a page, a footnote on a page, a section or sub-section, or a numbered paragraph. Citations must include specific reference to the point within the source being referred to. For cases, these specific references are known as pincites. </p>

        <p>Refer to the source’s page by its number or numbers. Do not use p. or pp. to indicate a page reference. Use “at” if needed for clarity.”</p>

        <p>Refer to a span of pages with a hyphen (-), an en dash (–), or the word “to” if needed for clarity. Note that an en dash is the proper standard for providing a span of pages in a formal legal publication, but hyphens are commonly used in practice. Drop all digits except the last two, unless needed for clarity.</p>

          <p class="inkling">Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes are three separate marks with mostly separate functions in citations and sentences. These marks all comprise short, horizontal lines that—with the help of glasses and/or a magnifying glass—you will see have microscopically varying lengths. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><b>Hyphens</b> (shortest in length) are used for phrasal adjectives (e.g., “laser-sharp focus,” “larger-than-life character,” and compound words (e.g., “daughter-in-law,” “over-the-counter”). Hyphens are also a feature of many statutory citation formats, such as Ala. Code § 27-14-24 and O.C.G.A. § 33-24-41. Meticulously preserve hyphens when they are intrinsically part of a citation, such as 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Hyphens are commonly used for page ranges in standard legal documents. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><b>En dashes</b> (longer than hyphens, shorter than em dashes) can be used for ranges of values (e.g., page ranges) and contrasting or connected pairs of words (e.g., Sarbanes–Oxley Act), especially in academic legal documents. </p>
          <p class="inkling"><b>Em dashes</b> (longest in length) are used for inserting a break in a thought; isolating a concluding phrase; setting on a parenthetical explanation or amplification; and signaling a collection of ideas. Here’s one example: “When her new Volkswagen was finally delivered—nearly three months after it was ordered and following the revelation of VW's massive scheme of emissions control fraud—Alice decided she didn't want it.”</p>

        <p>Cite a footnote on a page by providing the page, one space, the abbreviation “n.”, and the footnote number. Follow the same format for figures, historical notes, tables, and similar features. Refer to <a href="#t13">Table T13</a> for abbreviations such as “fig.” for “figure.” Do not add a space between the abbreviation and the number or letter designating the figure, footnote, historical note, or table. </p>

          <p class="inkling">The symbol “§” means “section,” and “§§” is the plural form. The section symbol can be inserted as a special character. Computer-keyboard shortcuts create the § symbol with just a few key strokes: [Option-6] on an Apple keyboard or [Alt-0167] on a Windows keyboard using the numeric keypad. Setting up a customized keyboard shortcut may be a good option for Windows users who generate legal citations on a regular basis. If using a mobile device, you may be able to insert a section into text such as by tapping and holding the “&amp;” key. </p>
