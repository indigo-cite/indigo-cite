        <h4 id="r4-1"><a href="#toc_r4-1">R4.1 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Function of Signals</a></h4>
        <p>A signal represents the relationship between the author’s assertion and the source or sources cited following that assertion, a relationship that can run the gamut from supporting it directly to supporting the exact opposite of that assertion. To show this relationship, the signal begins the citation sentence or clause. </p>
        <h4 id="r4-2"><a href="#toc_r4-2">R4.2 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Categories of Signals</a></h4>
        <p>There are four basic categories of signals:</p>

        <h4 id="r4-3"><a href="#toc_r4-3">R4.3 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Combinations of Signals</a></h4>
        <p>When more than one category of authority is used in the same citation, they should be ordered according to categories of signals. As shown in the table above, the categories follow a logical order: supporting authority is provided before comparative and contradictory authority, and general background. </p>
        <p>In citation sentences, signals in the same category are listed within a single sentence, and each one is marked off by semicolons. Signals in separate categories, however, are listed in separate citation sentences.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b><span class="wide-space">  </span>Example:</b></p>
        <blockquote>Justice Scalia once noted that “the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.” <i>Arizona v. Hicks</i>, 480 U.S. 321, 329 (1987). <i>But see</i> <i>Maryland v. King</i>, 569 U.S. 435, 462-463 (2013) (acknowledging the existence of “programmatic searches of either the public at large or a particular class of regulated but otherwise law-abiding citizens” such as motorist checkpoints).</blockquote>
        <blockquote>In citation clauses, all signals (regardless of category) are listed within a single citation clause and separated by semicolons.</blockquote>

        <h4 id="r4-4"><a href="#toc_r4-4">R4.4 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Authorities Cited Within Each Signal</a></h4>
        <p>For the order of authorities cited after (and thus within each signal), order them in a helpful and logical manner, and use a semicolon in between each one.</p>
        <div class="inkling-box">
          <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling </p>
          <p class="inkling">String citations are not always desirable or appropriate, especially in standard legal documents. Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert of the Third Circuit describes string citations as “generally irritating and useless.” Alexa Chew, <i>Stylish Legal Citation</i>, 71 Ark. L. Rev. 823, 858 n. 214 (2019) (quoting Judge Aldisert in <i>Winning on Appeal: Better Briefs and Oral Arguments</i> 57 (2d ed. 2003). On the other hand, after a carefully crafted proposition drawn from several authorities, a string cite may be “the right tool for the job.” <i>Id.</i> at 859. </p>
          <p class="inkling">When a string citation is appropriate, the writer must decide how to order the authorities in the string. In relatively recent years, academic legal documents have followed an elaborate hierarchy, which essentially consists of the following: constitutions before statutes, state statutes in alphabetical order by state, federal cases before state cases, legislative materials before regulatory materials, and all other primary materials, then followed by secondary materials. See <i>The Indigo Book: A Manual of Legal Citation </i><a href="#r10">Rule R10</a> (1st ed. 2016); <i>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</i> Rule 1.4 (20th ed. 2015). This hierarchy often does, in fact, provide the most logical order; it seems unwise to cite Wikipedia before the United States Constitution, for example. But this hierarchy may not always fit the situation. The Uniform System of Citation is evolving to encompass more flexibility and discretion in a few pockets here and there, such as the basic principle that authorities cited in a string within a single signal should be placed in a helpful and logical order.</p>

          <li>The source makes the same assertion as the sentence it is supporting. <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
            <blockquote>To impose the death penalty on an individual who is criminally insane is unconstitutional. <i>Ford v. Wainwright</i>, 477 U.S. 399, 410 (1986).</blockquote>

        <p>Use <i>e.g.</i>, if the cited source is one of multiple sources to make the same assertion. The citation may include however many sources the author finds to be helpful. Note that the comma in the signal <i>e.g.</i>, should not be italicized.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote>In a criminal case, the state bears the burden of proving the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>State v. Purrier</i>, 336 P.3d 574, 576 (Or. Ct. App. 2014).</blockquote>

        <p><i>E.g.</i>, may also be used following any other signal, such as <i>See</i> or <i>Contra</i> in which case an italicized comma should separate the two signals. </p>
        <h5 id="r4-6-3"><a href="#toc_r4-6-3">R4.6.3<span class="wide-space">  </span><i>Accord</i></a></h5>
        <p><i>Accord </i>is used when more than one source substantiates a proposition, but the text quotes just one of them. Use <i>accord</i> as the introductory signal for the non-quoted sources. Also, <i>accord</i> may be used as the introductory signal for indicating that the law of one jurisdiction is consistent with the law of another.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>

        <p><i>See</i> is used when an authority does not directly state but clearly supports the proposition. <i>See </i>is used instead of no signal when an inferential step is required to connect the proposition to the authority cited.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">  </span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Citizens have less training than police on detecting crime and no authority to detain other individuals; thus, citizens’ duty to report crime is based on reasonable grounds to believe a crime has been committed, rather than the more exacting probable cause standard. <i>See</i> <i>Lunsford v.

        <p><i>See also</i> is used for additional sources that support an assertion. Use <i>see also</i> when authority that states or clearly supports the assertion has already been cited or discussed. The use of a parenthetical is recommended with <i>see also</i>.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">  </span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Slayer statutes prevent killers from reaping rewards from committing homicide. <i>Lunsford v. W.

        <p><i>Cf.</i> indicates support by analogy to the assertion. It may also be used where the source is related but requires some interpretive work to connect to the assertion. <i>Cf.</i> may also be used within a string citation to provide another source that is analogous to the previously cited source in that string. Always use a parenthetical with <i>cf.</i> to explain the logical connection required for the argument.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Examples:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Attorneys have an ethical duty of competence, but under Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 comment 3, that duty may be relaxed in emergency situations. <i>Cf. Carter v. Reese</i>, 2016-Ohio-4559, 70 N.E.3d 478 (holding that Good Samaritan law protects from liability anyone giving medical or nonmedical emergency aid, not only healthcare workers providing medical aid).</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Slayer statutes seek to eliminate any financial incentive to commit murder by prohibiting insurance proceeds to the killer. <i>E.g.</i>, Unif. Prob. Code § 2-803; <i>cf.</i> N.Y. Exec. Law § 632-a (2020) (seizing profits from publications by certain incarcerated felons).</blockquote>
        <h5 id="r4-6-7"><a href="#toc_r4-6-7">R4.6.7 <span class="wide-space">  </span><i>See generally</i></a></h5>
        <blockquote><i>See generally</i> is used for useful background material. It is recommended that you use a parenthetical with <i>see generally</i> in order to explain the authority’s relevance to the proposition.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">  </span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The slayer rule is a product of common law principles prohibiting killers from profiting their crimes. <i>See generally </i>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 45(2) (Am.

        <p><i>Compare … with …</i> is used when the relationship of multiple authorities will demonstrate or offer support for the proposition. It is highly recommended that each authority in the comparison be explained with a parenthetical in order to make the relationship and argument clear to the reader. </p>
        <p>Each portion of the <i>compare </i>…<span class="wide-space">  </span><i>with</i> … signal may contain multiple sources. Separate these sources using commas and italicized <i>and</i> between the penultimate and ultimate citation in the list. </p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote>The 20th Century saw sweeping changes in the definition and scope of the Due Process Clause. <i>Compare</i> <i>Lochner v.

City of Tigard</i>, 512 U.S. 374 (1994) (limiting the zoning and ordinance powers of local governments under the Due Process Clause).</blockquote>
        <p>Insert a comma before <i>with</i>. As with all citation sentences, insert a period to conclude the citation sentence. It is theoretically possible to conclude with a semicolon and continue with more signals and citations in the order listed within this rule, but probably not advisable.

        <p><i>But see</i> is used for authority that, while not directly contradicting the main proposition, nonetheless clearly opposes it. <i>But see</i> is the opposite signal to <i>see</i>.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Example:</b> The Supreme Court noted in <i>Packingham v. North Carolina</i>, 137 S.

        <p>Prepare yourself, and use this one sparingly: <i>But cf.</i> indicates that the cited source supports an assertion that is similar to the opposite of the main assertion. It follows that <i>But cf.</i> is the opposite signal to <i>cf.</i> indicating support by analogy. Always use a parenthetical with <i>but cf.</i> to explain the logical connection required for the argument. This is the weakest signal for contrary authority.</p>
