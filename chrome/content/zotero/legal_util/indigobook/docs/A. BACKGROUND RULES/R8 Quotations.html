        <p>Quotations of 49 words or less should be designated with double quotation marks that open and close the quotation. Do not use quotation marks around block quotations (see <a href="#r9">Rule R9</a> for block quotations.)</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of a consumer-deception claim against a legal publisher: “Under the circumstances, plaintiffs, or any reasonable consumer, could not have been materially misled to believe that defendant guaranteed Part III of the Tanbook was complete and accurate at any given time.”</p>
        <p>The court ruled that “a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances here would not have believed that defendant represented that the section at issue, containing rent control statutes and regulations, was current and accurate for its one-year shelf life.”</p>
        <h5 id="r8-1-2"><a href="#toc_r8-1-2">R8.1.2<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">  </span>Punctuation with quotations</a></h5>
        <p>Punctuation that is part of the quoted text should appear inside the quotation marks. When the quotation is embedded into the sentence using a comma or a period added by the writer at the end of the quotation, that comma or period also appears inside the quotation marks (even though it is not part of the actual quoted text from the source). Punctuation added to a quotation anywhere other than at the end of the quoted material is an alteration that should be indicated with brackets.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p><span class="wide-space">  </span>Legal professionals are “merely a subclass of consumers.” </p>
        <blockquote>Given that legal professionals are “merely a subclass of consumers,” New York’s consumer deception law does apply to them.</blockquote>
        <h5 id="r8-1-3"><a href="#toc_r8-1-3">R8.1.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Citation placement </a></h5>
        <p>Insert a citation sentence for the quoted material after the end of the sentence. Insert the citation as a clause if needed for clarity about which portion of the sentence is attributable to the source. Citations can be full citations or short citations, as appropriate to the surrounding context.</p>

        <p>Any substitutions into quoted material should be bracketed. This includes words which might add clarity and context, and changes to the capitalization of letters</p>

        <p>Use the following phrases attached to a legal citation following a quotation, to indicate changes made to that quotation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(emphasis added) </li>

        <p>When using a quotation within a quotation, you can either (1) attribute it to the original source with a parenthetical, or (2) acknowledge it by signaling that its citation has been omitted.</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><span class="wide-space">  </span><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <blockquote>Just as the Supreme Court has held that an official statement of the case, syllabus, or headnote prepared by judges “fall within the ‘work they perform in their capacity as judges,’ so too annotations published by legislators alongside the statutory text fall within the work legislators perform in their capacity as legislators.” <i>Georgia v. Public.Resource.org</i>, 140 S. Ct. 1498, 1509 (2020) (quoting <i>Banks v. Manchester</i>, 128 U.S. 244, 253 (1888)).</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Although the annotations are not enacted into law through bicameralism and presentment, the Commission's preparation of the annotations is under Georgia law an act of ‘legislative authority,’ and the annotations provide commentary and resources that the legislature has deemed relevant to understanding its laws.” <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</blockquote>
        <h5 id="r8-2-6"><a href="#toc_r8-2-6">R8.2.6 <span class="wide-space">  </span>Unnecessary parentheticals</a></h5>
        <p>The following should <i>not</i> be indicated in a parenthetical:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(emphasis in original) </li>
        </ul>

          <p class="inkling">Dealing with quoted material can be minutely technical, as with parentheticals such as (citation omitted, internal quotation marks removed, and second emphasis omitted). To simplify and streamline citations and replace the granular detail of such parentheticals, attorney Jack Metzler has proposed and promoted a shorter parenthetical to handle such situations: (cleaned up). The parenthetical (cleaned up) after a quotation and citation indicates essentially that the writer has adjusted the citation’s mechanics to the situation and will not list and elaborate on each mechanical modification, but is indicating to the reader that small tweaks have been made for clarity and convenience. </p>
          <p class="inkling">The (cleaned up) parenthetical has not become part of the Uniform System of Citation—yet. It has, however, actually been used in thousands of federal and state judicial opinions. <i>See</i> Jack Metzler, <i>Cleaning Up Citations</i>, 18 J. App. Prac. &amp; Process 142 (2017). The (cleaned up) approach is not without its critics, though, who argue that transparently meticulous care with quotations enhances the writer’s credibility and does not unduly distract readers. Writers will need to make individual decisions whether to consider (cleaned up), depending on their role and their audience. Apart from these individual decisions, the (cleaned up) parenthetical provides yet more evidence that legal citation can and does evolve not just through the periodic publication of citation rules but through practice and dialogue within the legal community. </p>

        <p>An omission is indicated by an ellipsis where the words are omitted:<span class="wide-space">  </span>. . .</p>
        <p>The ellipsis in legal writing is represented by three periods and four spaces. </p>
        <p>Insert a space after the last letter of the preceding phrase, a space between each period, and a space before the first letter of the following phrase. Rules<a href="#r8-3-2"> R8.3.2</a>-R8.3.7 contain rules and examples for incorporating ellipses in various situations.</p>
        <h5 id="r8-3-2"><a href="#toc_r8-3-2">R8.3.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Omission from the beginning of a quoted sentence</a></h5>
        <p>When omitting the beginning of a quoted sentence, do not use an ellipsis. Instead, capitalize the first letter and place it in brackets. If the first letter of the quoted material is already capitalized, no change is needed, but—as with all quotes—ensure that the quotation is accurate in context.<span class="wide-space">  </span></p>

        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote>“The difference between actual and red flag knowledge is . . . between a subjective and an objective standard.”</blockquote>

        <h5 id="r8-3-5"><a href="#toc_r8-3-5">R8.3.5<span class="wide-space">  </span>Omission at the end of a sentence</a></h5>
        <p>When omitting the end of a quoted sentence, insert an ellipsis between the last letter quoted and the punctuation mark of the original quote.</p>
        <blockquote class="no-break-after"><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>
        <blockquote>“The difference between actual and red flag knowledge is thus not between specific and generalized knowledge . . . .”</blockquote>
        <p>When omitting material at the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next sentence, use one ellipsis to mark the omission but include the final punctuation mark of the first sentence as well as bracket and capitalize the first letter of the following sentence.</p>

        <blockquote>“The difference between actual and red flag knowledge is thus not between specific and generalized knowledge . . . .

        <p>When omitting a footnote or citation from quoted material, do not insert an ellipsis. Do insert a parenthetical indicating the omission immediately after the citation to the quoted source. <i>See</i> <a href="#r8-2-6">Rule R8.2.6</a>.</p>

          <p class="inkling">The ellipsis is traditionally made with four spaces and three periods . . . but computers have keyboard shortcuts to produce an ellipsis that constitutes one single character. For example, option-semicolon on an Apple keyboard produces … as its ellipsis shortcut.<span class="wide-space">  </span>While the ellipsis shortcut character is not officially sanctioned in any citation manual, some practitioners use it freely in court filings. </p>
          <p class="inkling">Non-substantive tweaks to citations to meet a word count appear to be a modest but burgeoning trend. The 21st edition of <i>The Bluebook</i> breaks with tradition in allowing writers to omit previously required spaces in a citation such as 123 F. Supp. 2d 456, turning it into 123 F.Supp.2d 456. This unspaced citation may look incorrect to many legal readers. But if a legal writer is making choices to meet a difficult word count, we submit that the ellipsis shortcut key may be a worthwhile tradeoff as well. </p>
