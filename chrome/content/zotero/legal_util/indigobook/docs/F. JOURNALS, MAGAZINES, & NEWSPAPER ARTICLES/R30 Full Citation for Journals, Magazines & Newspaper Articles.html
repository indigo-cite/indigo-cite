          <p class="inkling">Many sources such as newspapers and magazines are available both in a traditional hard-copy publication and an online format. Although the online site is almost certainly easier to find and read, traditional legal citation prioritizes the hard-copy publication for law reviews, magazines, and similar periodical sources. Newspapers are treated differently as shown in <a href="#r30-4">Rule R30.4</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="r30-2"><a href="#toc_r30-2">R30.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Authors</a></h4>
        <h5 id="r30-2-1"><a href="#toc_r30-2-1">R30.2.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Name as listed</a></h5>
        <p>Show the author’s name beginning with first name, initials if indicated on the publication, and last name followed by any name suffixes (Jr., III) indicated on the publication title.</p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-2"><a href="#toc_r30-2-2">R30.2.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Two authors</a></h5>
        <p>For two authors, indicate their names in the order shown on the publication, separated by an ampersand. Do not insert a comma before the ampersand.</p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-3"><a href="#toc_r30-2-3">R30.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Multiple authors</a></h5>
        <p>For more than two authors, all authors may be listed with an ampersand before the last name; or all but the first may be omitted and replaced by “et al.” Indicate all authors when relevant the point being made, or when recognition of all authors is desirable.</p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-4"><a href="#toc_r30-2-4">R30.2.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>No listed author</a></h5>
        <p>When no author is listed at the beginning or end of the publication source, skip the author field and begin the citation with the publication’s title.<span class="wide-space">  </span></p>
        <h4 id="r30-3"><a href="#toc_r30-3">R30.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Journal Titles</a></h4>
        <h5 id="r30-3-1"><a href="#toc_r30-3-1">R30.3.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Abbreviated titles</a></h5>
        <p>Use the abbreviations for common institutional names as listed in <a href="#t15">Table T15</a> if the name is listed. If the institutional name is not listed in <a href="#t15">Table T15</a>, use abbreviations as listed in <a href="#t11">Table T11</a> and <a href="#t12">Table T12</a>. If the periodical title has an abbreviation in it, use the abbreviation. If the word is not found in any of these tables, do not abbreviate the word in the abbreviated title.</p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-2"><a href="#toc_r30-2-2">R30.2.2<span class="wide-space">  </span>Prepositions, articles, commas, and colons</a></h5>
        <p>For journals not listed in the tables, streamline the journal title with these grammar mechanics. Do not use the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” in the abbreviated title. Do, however, use the word “on.” If the title consists of “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” or “the” followed by a single word, do not abbreviate the remaining word. Omit all commas in abbreviated titles, but retain other punctuation. If a periodical title has a colon followed by words, omit all that from the abbreviated title. </p>
        <p>Use discretion to format a journal title differently when the journal identifies its own abbreviated title differently, particularly for legal journals (as opposed to those from other disciplines using other citation conventions).</p>
        <p class="no-break-after"><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>“Sociological Journal of Law” becomes “Socio. J. Law”</p>
        <p>“Law Journal on the Litigation World” becomes “L.J. on Litig. World”</p>
        <p>“Journal at Legal Crossroads” becomes “J. Legal Crossroads”</p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-3"><a href="#toc_r30-2-3">R30.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span>Online supplements</a></h5>
        <p>To cite an online supplement to a print publication, use the proper abbreviation for the print publication, followed by the name of the online supplement. </p>
        <h5 id="r30-2-4"><a href="#toc_r30-2-4">R30.2.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Evolving journal titles and series designation</a></h5>
        <p>If a periodical has been renumbered into a new series, indicate that by prefacing the series number with “(n.s.)”. Use the title of the periodical on the issue you are citing, even if the name of the periodical has changed.</p>
        <h4 id="r30-4"><a href="#toc_r30-4">R30.4<span class="wide-space">  </span>Newspaper Articles</a></h4>
        <p>Citations to newspaper articles traditionally required the print-based citation, but now may use either the print-based citation or the online citation with exact date and URL consistent with <a href="#r32">Rule R32</a>.</p>
        <h5 id="r30-4-1"><a href="#toc_r30-4-1">R30.4.1<span class="wide-space">  </span>Print-based citation to newspaper article</a></h5>
        <p>Citations to <b>newspaper articles</b> take the following form: &lt;Author’s Name(s), if signed>, &lt;Italicized Title of the Article>, &lt;Name of Publication, abbreviated>, &lt;full date of publication>, at &lt;number of first page of article>. Add a designation after the author’s name such as “editorial,” where appropriate.</p>
