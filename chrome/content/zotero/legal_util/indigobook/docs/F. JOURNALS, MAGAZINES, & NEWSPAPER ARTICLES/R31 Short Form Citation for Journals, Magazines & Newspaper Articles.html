        <h4 id="r31-1"><a href="#toc_r31-1">R31.1<span class="wide-space">  </span> <span class="wide-space">  </span><i>Id.</i></a></h4>
        <p>Use “<i>id.</i>” when referring to the source cited in the immediately preceding citation. <i>Id.</i> can be used to refer to the same source as in a preceding citation that is itself also <i>id.</i>, but do not repeat <i>id.</i> more than four times sequentially. After the fourth <i>id.</i>, add more information by repeating the full citation or providing a short citation with <i>supra</i>.</p>
        <p><i>Id.</i> may be used by itself to indicate the same page of the same source, or with “at” to indicate a different page of that source. </p>
        <h4 id="r31-2"><a href="#toc_r31-2">R31.2<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">  </span><i>Supra</i></a></h4>
        <p>Use “<i>supra</i>” when you’ve used the full citation before, but it’s not right next to the sentence you will provide the citation for now. Use a shortened title if you cite to multiple sources from the same author. Where a source has more than two authors, short citation forms using <i>supra</i> may use the first-named author and “et al.” to refer to other named authors, regardless of whether the first full citation has done so. You may retain all the authors if desired for giving credit.</p>
