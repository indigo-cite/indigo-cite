        <h2 id="i-codicil"><a href="#toc_i-codicil">I. CODICIL</a></h2>
        <p><i>Editor’s Note (2021): </i>The Codicil will be updated with additional information about the Second Edition. This is the Codicil from the First Edition.</p>
        <p><i>The Indigo Book: A Manual of Legal Citation</i> is distributed as a single document coded with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank">HTML 5</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</a> standards.</p>
        <p>Each rule and section of the file have a unique ID, making them individually addressable. Examples are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each Rule has an ID starting with the letter R and then the rule number. For example, Rule 1.1 can be addressed by adding <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html#R1.1" target="_blank">#R1.1</a> to the URL. </li>
          <li>Each Section has an ID starting with the letter S and then the rule letter. For example, the Codicil can be addressed by adding <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html#SK" target="_blank">#SK</a> to the URL. </li>
          <li>Each Table has an ID starting with the letter T and then the table number. For example, <a href="#t1-1">Table T1.1</a> can be addressed by adding <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html#T1.1" target="_blank">#T1.1</a> to the URL.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The header of the file calls two open source Google fonts. If those fonts are not available, the CSS style sheet falls back to Georgia, which is present on most computers, and then to the generic serif font. The fonts we use are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the cover, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alice" target="_blank">Alice</a>, which was designed by Ksenia Erulevich and inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel. </li>
          <li>For the body of the document, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Libre+Baskerville" target="_blank">Libre Baskerville</a>, based on the 1941 American Type Founder's Baskerville, but optimized for web use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To clearly distinguish our work from other citation manuals, we have forgone the use of the color <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_blue" target="_blank">Royal Blue</a> in favor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo" target="_blank">Indigo,</a> in solidarity with the ryots of Bengal who were oppressed by the insatiable British demand for blue and the profits that flowed from it, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_revolt" target="_blank">the Nilbridroha</a> (Indigo revolt) and the beginning of the road that led to independence.</p>
        <p>The CSS has been coded with support for printing on US Letter size paper. We use <a href="http://www.princexml.com/" target="_blank">Prince XML</a> to convert the HTML document to PDF format.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to dynamically change the styles to perform tasks such as making <i>all text in italics</i> “pop” by turning it crimson or back to normal.</p>
        <p>To create a file for use in Microsoft Word, an easy method is to comment out the calls to Google fonts, upload the document to Google Docs, and then downloading it in Word format.</p>
